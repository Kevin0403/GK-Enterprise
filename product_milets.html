                <p>Millets are <strong>a group of small-seeded grasses that are grown around the world as cereal crops
                        or grains
                        for fodder and human food.</strong> They are starchy grains that are rich in carbs and contain
                    several
                    vitamins and minerals. One cup (174 grams) of cooked millet contains 207 calories and 41 grams of
                    carbs. </p>

                        It millet has its origins in West Africa, where the oldest finds in Mauritania date to 1000
                        BC. It is primarily cultivated in sub-Saharan Africa.

                        It is the most
                        widely grown type of millet. It has been grown in Africa and the Indian subcontinent since
                        prehistoric times. The center of diversity, and suggested area of domestication, for the crop is
                        in the Sahel zone of West Africa.[2] Recent archaeobotanical research has confirmed the presence
                        of domesticated pearl millet on the Sahel zone of northern Mali between 2500 and 2000 BC.[3][4]
                        2023 is the International Year of Millets, declared by the United Nations General Assembly in
                        2021.
